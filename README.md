## Introduction

CatalogueSearch is an advanced document processing and search system specifically designed for multilingual PDF documents, with specialized support for Hindi and Gujarati texts. The system provides intelligent paragraph generation, semantic text processing, and powerful search capabilities combining both lexical and vector-based search methods.

The system uses OCR technology, natural language processing, and vector embeddings to create searchable document indexes from complex multilingual PDF content, and exposes them through an intuitive UI.

## High Level Architecture and Components

### Crawler
Responsible for document discovery and crawling operations. This module monitors directories, discovers out new PDF files, extracts text through OCR, chunks them into individual documents through sophisticated and language specific paragraph generation, and creates lexical and vector indexes to make the documents searchable. In addition, it also gathers document specific metadata to allow the users to search through categories.

The Crawler follows standard ETL (Extract-Tranform-Load) techniques.

### Search Engine and API Server
Provides dual-mode search capabilities:
- **Lexical Search**: Traditional keyword-based search using OpenSearch
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search using sentence transformers and vector embeddings
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines both approaches for optimal search results

The Search Engine uses OpenSearch as the backend, and uses **Vector Search and Rerankers** for better search results.


## Installation Instructions on macOS

### Prerequisites
Python 3.11+.

### Docker Installation
Docker is required for OpenSearch and testing components.

1. Install Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Start Docker Desktop and ensure it's running

### Tesseract OCR Installation
Tesseract is required for optical character recognition with multilingual support.

1. Install Tesseract using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install tesseract
    ```

2. Install language data for Hindi and Gujarati:
    ```bash
    brew install tesseract-lang
    ```

3. Verify installation and check available languages:
    ```bash
    tesseract --list-langs
    ```
    You should see `hin` (Hindi) and `guj` (Gujarati) in the list.

### Poppler Installation
Poppler is required for PDF to image conversion.

```bash
brew install poppler
```

### Indic NLP Resources Setup
Download and set up the Indic NLP resources for advanced language processing.

1. Clone the Indic NLP resources repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_resources.git
    ```

2. Set the environment variable to point to the resources:
    ```bash
    export INDIC_RESOURCES_PATH="/path/to/indic_nlp_resources"
    ```

3. Add this to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence:
    ```bash
    echo 'export INDIC_RESOURCES_PATH="/path/to/indic_nlp_resources"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

### Python Environment Setup

**NOTE**: Python's dependencies should be installed after setting up the above.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### Google Vision API Setup
For advanced OCR capabilities:

1. Install Google Cloud SDK following the [official installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
2. Set up authentication:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
    ```

### OpenSearch Setup
Start the required OpenSearch containers:

```bash
python scripts/opensearch_controller.py --start
```

To stop the containers:
```bash
python scripts/opensearch_controller.py --stop
```

### Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Running Tests
Execute the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

**Note**: Ensure Docker containers are running before executing tests that require OpenSearch.
