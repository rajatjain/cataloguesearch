# Complete requirements file - includes all dependencies for full development environment

# Include API requirements (which includes base)
-r requirements-api.txt

# Include crawler requirements (which includes base + PDF/OCR libraries)
-r requirements-crawler.txt

# This approach avoids duplication while ensuring all dependencies are available
# For production deployments:
# - Use requirements-api.txt for API containers (lightweight)
# - Use requirements-crawler.txt for document processing containers
# - Use this file for local development with full capabilities

# Development/Testing only dependencies
