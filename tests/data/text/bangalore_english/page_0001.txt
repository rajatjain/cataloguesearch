Bengaluru: India's 'Silicon Valley' and
'Garden City'
Page 1: An Introduction and Historical Background
Bengaluru, officially known as Bengaluru, is the capital of the Indian state of
Karnataka. It is India's third-largest city and fifth-largest metropolitan area. Due to its
pleasant climate, lush green landscapes, and rapidly growing technological sector, it is
often referred to as "India's Silicon Valley" and "Garden City." Situated on the Deccan
Plateau at an altitude of approximately 900 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level, the
city is known for its agreeable weather throughout the year, making it a popular place
to live.
Bengaluru boasts a rich and ancient history. In the Puranas, this place was known as
"Kalyanapuri" or "Kalyan Nagar." Until 1004 AD, it was an important part of the Ganga
Dynasty. An inscription called "Benga-valooru," which means "City of Guards" in
ancient Kannada, was found near Begur, providing evidence of its ancient existence.
From 1015 to 1116, the Chola rulers reigned here, after which its power passed into the
hands of the Hoysala Dynasty.
The foundation of modern Bengaluru was laid in 1537 by Kempe Gowda I, a feudatory
of the Vijayanagara Empire. He constructed a fort in the area, which is considered the
foundation of Bengaluru city today. Over time, this region became part of the
Marathas, the British, and finally the Kingdom of Mysore. During British rule, in 1831,
the capital of Mysore was shifted from Mysore city to Bengaluru. In 1949, the
Bengaluru Cantonment and Bengaluru City, which had developed as separate entities,
were merged, and the municipality was reorganized. After India's independence, in
1956, Bengaluru became the capital of the newly formed state of Karnataka. In 2006,
Bangalore was officially renamed Bengaluru, further connecting it to its roots.
