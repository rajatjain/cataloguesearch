Bengaluru has witnessed the rise and fall of several empires and rulers over centuries,
including figures like Tipu Sultan and Hyder Ali. These historical layers have shaped
the city's culture and architecture, which are still reflected in its streets and
monuments today. The city is known not only for its historical significance but also as
a cultural melting pot where people speaking Kannada, Tamil, and other languages
coexist.

Bengaluru's modern development is primarily focused on technology and innovation,
which has given it a prominent place on the global map. In the early 1970s, R. K.
Baliga, the Chairman and Managing Director of the Karnataka State Electronics
Development Corporation, proposed developing an Electronic City, which laid the
foundation for the city's technological boom. Today, Bengaluru is known as "India's IT
Capital" or "Silicon Valley," signifying its role as the country's leading information
technology (IT) exporter.
The city is home to the headquarters and development centers of countless IT
companies, including Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and many multinational corporations. It is
also fertile ground for startups, with a large number of new ventures launching every
year. Many successful Indian companies like Flipkart, Byju's, Myntra, and Big Basket
originated in Bengaluru. Bengaluru is also a leader in the field of biotechnology, with
approximately 50% of India's biotechnology companies located here.
This rapid economic growth has made Bengaluru one of India's fastest-developing
metropolises. Its estimated Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is around $83 billion,
making it India's fourth-largest city. This economic boom creates vast employment
opportunities, which is why people from various parts of India come to settle here.
According to an estimate, more than 51% of Bengaluru's population has migrated
from other Indian states, making it a vibrant and diverse cultural city.
